I'm now a Post-Doc in Bielefeld University, Germany, sponsored by [SFB-TRR 358 "Integral Structures in Geometry and Representation Theory"](https://trr358.math.uni-bielefeld.de). Before that, I was a PhD student in [SCMS, Fudan University](http://www.scms.fudan.edu.cn/), supervised by Zhiyuan Li. 

My research interests include
* Algebraic Geometry (especially on K3 surface and its higher-dimensional analogue);
* $$p$$-adic Geometry ($$p$$-adic cohomology theories, etc)

For detials, you can see the pdf-version CV [pdf](/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
